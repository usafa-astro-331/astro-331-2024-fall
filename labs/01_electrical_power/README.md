# Lab 1: electrical power

In this lab you will test FlatSAT's solar panel to determine if it will generate enough power to satisfy mission requirements. You will measure the voltage and current generated by the solar array at various voltages to generate an I-V plot. You will collect two sets of I-V measurements, one for a series-connected array and one for a parallel-connected array. 

You will also record solar illuminance with a luxmeter at the time of your power measurements. 

In your post-lab analysis, you will compare your prelab performance predictions to the results you record in this lab. You will present your I-V plot and use it to identify your array's peak power. You will calculate array efficiency using the incident luminosity and the peak power generated. Finally, you will recommend any design changes necessary to ensure the solar array can meet mission requirements.

# Prelab activities

If you have not already completed 00b_metrology, measure your solar panel's output limits (maximum current and voltage in series and in parallel). 

|          | voltage (V) | current (mA) |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| series   |             |              |
| parallel |             |              |

Record which solar panel you are using.

Connect the four cells of the array in series. You will complete the data collection steps, and then repeat them with the cells connected in parallel.

Connect components according to this schematic. 

![](sources/electrical_schematic.svg)

Ensure all grounds/ground rails are connected. 

Connect the current sensor using I2C. If using a QWIIC cable: 

- Black = GND
- Red = 3.3V
- Blue = SDA
- Yellow = SCL

### prepare microSD card

The Arduino MKR Zero has a microSD card slot. You will use this card to store data in various labs. If this is your first lab with an SD card, prepare the card. 

- insert the card in the USB reader and connect to your computer
- Format the card using FAT32
  - Window Explorer -> Right click -> format -> Fat 32 -> Ok
  - When you format the card, name it after your group
- Insert the card into your Arduino MKR Zero

## upload FlatSAT code and test setup

Open `lab_01_electrical_power.ino` in the Arduino IDE. 

Connect Arduino to computer via USB. 

Select the correct board (Arduino MKRZERO) and port. 

Upload your code. 

Open serial monitor (tools -> serial plotter).

Slowly turn the potentiometer and watch the current and voltage change in the serial plotter. (Deselect ‘value 1’, which is time.)

## data collection scheme

FlatSAT saves current and voltage to `iv_curve.tsv` every 200 ms. On each powerup it writes a legend and then begins logging data. Subsequent powerups will again write a legend and add more data to the file. The legend message can be used to identify separate test runs. It will be obvious which run is series vs parallel. 

## collect solar array performance data outside

**Disconnect power to the Arduino so you're not saving excess data. **

Take FlatSAT and the luxmeter outside and find a test site in direct sunlight. 

Point the luxmeter toward the sun and record the sun's power in lux. You will have to adjust the range to its maximum setting. The measured value may jump around, try to take an average value. Record the average for later use calculating efficiency. 

Point FlatSAT at the sun and power it on. *Very* slowly (slower than you’re thinking), turn the potentiometer from one end to the other. FlatSAT will record current and voltage at 200 ms intervals. 

Remove the potentiometer to record a measurement of $V_{oc}$. Short the potentiometer pins with a wire to record a measurement of $I_{sc}$. 

**Disconnect power to the Arduino, **rewire the solar array in parallel, and repeat these steps to collect the parallel I-V data. 

## cleanup

Transfer `iv_curve.tsv` to your computer for later analysis. When finished, replace the SD card in FlatSAT. 

Leave all FlatSAT components and wires connected for future labs. 

Turn off everything and straighten your work area.
